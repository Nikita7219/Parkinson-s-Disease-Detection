# **🧠** Parkinson's Disease Detection Using CNN

## **📌 Introduction**

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting movement control, highlighting the importance of timely detection and intervention to improve patient quality of life. However, accurate diagnosis remains challenging due to its similarity with other neurological conditions, leading to a 25% rate of inaccurate manual diagnoses. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer a promising solution for medical image classification and analysis, capable of learning complex patterns in images. In this study, we introduce an innovative automated diagnostic model using CNN that provides an appropriate output indicating whether a person is diagnosed with PD or not.

✔ Utilize the **Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI)** dataset, which provides     benchmarked MRI images of PD and healthy controls.  
✔ Differentiate between PD and non-PD cases with high accuracy.

## **⚙ Methods**

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is a deep learning algorithm suitable for medical image classification and analysis as it can learn complex patterns in images and identify hidden trends in data.  
We have used:

* **VGG16** and **ResNet50** pretrained CNN models to achieve high accuracy and prediction.  
* Various algorithms and activation functions such as **EfficientNetB0**, **EfficientNetB1**, and **Softmax**, **Sigmoid**, and **ReLU** to validate performance.
